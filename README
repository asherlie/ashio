ashio includes two functions for reading from stdin


char* getline_raw(int* bytes_read, _Bool* tab) reads lines from stdin with
the terminal in raw mode

*bytes_read is set to the length of the input in
*tab is set to 1 if input was terminated with a tab character - this is help
ful for implementing tab completion

the char* returned by getline_raw() should be freed


char* tab_complete(void* data_douplep, int data_blk_sz, int data_offset, int optlen,
                   char iter_opts, int* bytes_read, _Bool* free_s);

data_offset is offset into data where char* can be found
this is set to 0 if data_douplep is a char*

data_douplep can be set to either a char** with data_blk_sz as sizeof(char*) and data_offset as 1
or a struct x* with data_blk_sz sizeof(struct x) and data_offset as (x[0].str-x)

the _Bool pointed to by free_s is set to 1 if returned buffer should be freed */
